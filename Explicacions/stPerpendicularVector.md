# stPerpendicular Vector

A stPerpendicular Vector to a given stVector a is obtained by reflecting a about an assymptpotic line ( a line passing through the base of a and with unitary slope.

In the Euclidean case, a Perpendicular Vector to a given Vector a = (a1,a2) in the (x,y) plane is obtained by making the Cross Product a x e3, where e3 is the unit vector atthe z axis.

In the same way, but now in the Minkowskian (1,1)D spacetime, a stPerpendicular stVector to a given stVector a = (a1, a0) is obtained by making the stCross Product a x e0, where e0 is the unit vector at the time axis.
