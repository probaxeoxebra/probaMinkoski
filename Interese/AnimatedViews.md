# Animated Views

Working with spacetime diagrams has the added advantage that we can always add animation to them.

This is possible because one of the dimensions is time, and animating a figure, in this case, 
is simply to displace a spatial projection of the spacetime diagram towards the positive direction of time.

[As we have seen](../Interese/ThreeDimensions.md), the position of the directions in the combined three-dimensional and two-dimensional GeoGebra Views
means that the animation of aspatial figure should be regarded as if the screen advances towards our direction. 
In this case, the spatial plane in the three-dimensional view shoud advance upwards.

A different approach is to consider that it is time which is passing through a fixed spatial "slice" of reality.
In this case, time would pass across the screen fleeing from us (2D spatial view) and the whole three-dimensional diagrams would slide backwards through the fixed "reality spatial plane".
