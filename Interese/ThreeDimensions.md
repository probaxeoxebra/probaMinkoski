# Three Dimensions

The future development of this proposal should include a dimensional increase, similar to the 3D version of GeoGebra in relation to the basic 2D plane.

The Euclidean 3D space is isotropic, which means that its properties are the same in all directions.

The Minkowskian (2,1) spacetime makes a clear distinction between spatial and temporal directions, and this has as a consequence that we should consider two kinds of relationship between the three-dimensional spacetime and some bidimensional subspace. 

The following figure shows, at the left, the Euclidean 3D perspective and next to it the 2D View (grey plane). This same View should be also an option when dealing with the (2,1) minkowskian spacetime, (right), but we should have also the opportunity to view an alternative (simplified) (1,1)spaceplane (green plane). 

The figures present also the light cone for the (2,1)D View and the light Diagonals for this (1,1)D View (both in red)
