# Three Dimensions

The future development of this proposal should include a dimensional increase, similar to the 3D version of GeoGebra in relation to the basic 2D plane.

The Euclidean 3D space is isotropic, which means that its properties are the same in all directions.

The Minkowskian (2,1) spacetime makes a clear distinction between spatial and temporal directions, and this has as a consequence that we should consider two kinds of relationship between the three-dimensional spacetime and some bidimensional subspace. 

The following figure shows, at the left, the Euclidean 3D perspective and next to it the 2D View (grey plane). This same View should be also an option when dealing with the (2,1) minkowskian spacetime, (right), but we should have also the opportunity to view an alternative (simplified) (1,1)spaceplane (green plane). 

The figures present also the light cone for the (2,1)D View and the light Diagonals for this (1,1)D View (both in red)

When working on a three-dimensional enviroenment for spacetime, the Euclidean 2D View should be regarded as if time increases from the computer screen towards us. We can alternatively consider that we are looking towards the past. 

This is specially interesting when considering the possibility of adding [Animations}(../Interese/AnimatedViews.md) to these diagrams.

The following figures are snapshots from pairs of three-dimensional GeoGebra Views (Right) and their two-dimensional counterparts (Left).

First, we see the standard euclidean 2D (x,y) and 3D (x,y,z) views at the published version of GeoGebra.

The next figures show the usual 2D (x,y) euclidean plane (it is the same as in the previous figure), and the proposed (2,1) View (x,y,t). The grey horizontal plane is the same (x,y) plane to its left, and the green vertical plane corresponds to the (1,1)D  Minkowskian (x,t) spacetime which can be seen at the next figure (left)

The last figure shows (left) a View of the (1,1)D minkowskian (x,t) spacetime plane (the one which is depicted in green at the previous figure) together with the proposed three-dimensional View for the (2,1) minkowskian (x,y,t) spacetime (it is the same as in the previous figure, but with a different perspective)
